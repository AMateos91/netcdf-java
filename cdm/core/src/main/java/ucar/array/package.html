<BODY>
Multidimensional arrays stored in memory. Replaces ucar.ma2.
<p>
  Primitive arrays are byte, char, double, float, int, long, short, String.
  The unsigned integral types use their signed versions, and the caller must widen if desired.
  The enums are mapped to byte, short or int.
  Boolean is represented as byte, 0 = false, non-zero = true.
  Opaque is Vlen of byte[].
  Vlen and Structure are handled seperately, eg you cant use Arrays.factory().
